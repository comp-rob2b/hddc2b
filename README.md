# hddc2b

`hddc2b` is a C library that provides building blocks (2b) for solving planar, two-dimensional kinematics and statics problems of mobile robots that feature a hub-drive with differential-castor (HDDC) kinematics configuration such as the [KELO Robotics](<https://www.kelo-robotics.com/products/>) platforms.
The library is complemented by a code generator that composes these building blocks into a wide range of concrete solvers as specified via a JSON-based configuration language.

By design, `hddc2b` only supports two levels of task hierarchy and deliberately excludes a velocity distribution solver.
The library is directly compatible with the data structure layout of the KELO Robotics interface provided by the [`robif2b`](https://github.com/rosym-project/robif2b) library.


More details of HDDC platforms and their integration into overall robot control architectures are also explained in [this online book](https://robmosys.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/).

## Documentation

The documentation comprises

* the [installation instructions](docs/installation.rst)
* [code generator](docs/code_generation.rst) instructions
* a [mathematical derivation](docs/least_squares.rst) of the solvers
* a [frame diagram](docs/frames.rst) for KELO robots
* an [example](src/example/hddc2b_example.c) that showcases how to use the solver.
